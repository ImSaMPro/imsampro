Hi, My name is Soumyadeep Mandal (SaM). I'm a full-stack developer who is passionate about building community, creating technology that elevates people, and spreading access to open source. I particularly liked working with the technologies Html/CSS, VueJs, NextJs and NodeJs.

I love to contribute to Open Source projects as it motivates me to pay a lot more attention to software design, testing, and documentation. I like to explore new technologies and love to work with them.

I think that every technology has its own strengths and can be used in unique ways, so I like to combine all of my knowledge and abilities to create something new and innovative.

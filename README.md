<i>I love to contribute to Open Source projects as it motivates me to pay a lot more attention to software design, testing, and documentation. I like to explore new technologies and love to work with them.

I think that every technology has its own strengths and can be used in unique ways, so I like to combine all of my knowledge and abilities to create something new and innovative.</i>
